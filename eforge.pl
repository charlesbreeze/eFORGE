=head1 NAME

eforge.pl - Experimentally derived Functional element Overlap analysis of ReGions from EWAS.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

eforge.pl options (-f file) (-mvp mvplist)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Analyse a set of MVPs for their overlap with DNase 1 hotspots compared to matched background MVPs. 
Identifies enrichment in DHS by tissue and plots graphs and table to display. Arbitrarily a minumum of 5* MVPs is required.  
Note that if no MVPs are given the script will run on A DEFAULT EWAS* as an example output.

Several outputs are made.

A straight base R graphics pdf chart of the data.

A polychart (https://github.com/Polychart/polychart2) interactive javascript graphic using rCharts (http://ramnathv.github.io/rCharts/).

A dimple (http://dimplejs.org) d3 interactive graphic using rCharts.

A table using the Datatables (https://datatables.net) plug-in for the jQuery Javascript library, again accessed through rCharts.

In each of the graphics the colouring should be consistent. Blue (p value > 0.05), light red or pink (0.05 => p value > 0.01), red or dark red (p value <= 0.01 ) for the 95% and 99% cIs. 
Or whatever other thresholds are specified. 

eForge functions, plotting options and stats are provided by eForge::eForge, eForge::ePlot and eForge::eStats modules.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<data>

Dataset to analyse. Either ENCODE data ('encode') or Roadmap Epigenome data ('erc'). erc by default.

=item B<peaks>

Use peaks instead of hotspots. Peaks are more stringent DNase1 peaks calls representing DNase hypersensitive sites, 
rather than hotspots which are regions of generalised DNase1 sensitivity or open chromatin. Default is to use hotspots.

=item B<bkgd>

Background is set at default to 450k array ('450k'), the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.

For the time being, it is suficient for MVPs to be on the 450k array. Probes within 1kb of each other will undergo filtering.

=item B<label>

Supply a label that you want to use for the plotting titles, and filenames.

=item B<f>

Supply the name of a file containing a list of MVPs. 
Format must be given by the -format flag. 
If not supplied the analysis is performed either on mvps provided as probeids (cg or ch probes) in a comma separated list through the mvps option 
or on a set of data from a default ewas* study (provide link for study here*). Note that 5* MVPs are required at a minimum.

=item B<mvps>

Can provide the mvps as probeids in a comma separated list.

=item B<min_mvps>

Specify the minimum number of MVPs to be allowed. Default is 5 now we are using binomial test.

=item B<thresh>

Alter the default binomial p value thresholds. Give a comma separate list of three e.g. 0.05,0.01 for the defaults

=item B<format>

If f is specified, specify the file format as follow:

probeid = list of mvps as probeids each on a separate line. Optionally can add other fields after the probeid which are ignored, 
unless the pvalue filter is specified, in which case eForge assumes that the second field is the minus log10 pvalue

bed  = File given is a bed file of locations (chr\tbeg\tend).  bed format should be 0 based and the chromosome should be given as chrN. 
However we will also accept chomosomes as just N (ensembl) and 1-based format where beg and end are the same*.

tabix = File contains MVPs in tabix format.

ian = 1-based chr\tbeg\tend\tprobeid\tpval\tminuslog10pval

=item B<filter>

Set a filter on the MVPs based on the -log10 pvalue.  This works for files in the 'ian' or 'probeid' format. 
Give a value as the lower threshold and only MVPs with -log10 pvalues >= to the threshold will be analysed. Default is no filtering.

=item B<bkgrd>

Output background stats for investigation.

=item B<reps>

The number of background matching sets to pick and analyse. Default 1000*.

=item B<proxy>

Apply filter for MVPs in proximity (within 1 kb of another test MVP). With proximity filter specified, eForge will report MVPs removed due to proximity with another MVP in the list and will randomly pick one of the probes among the set of probes that are in proximity (within 1 kb of each other).
To turn off proximity filtering specify -noproxy

=item B<noproxy>

Turn off proximity filtering.

=item B<depletion>

Analyse for DHS depletion pattern instead of the default DHS enrichment analysis. Use when dealing with datasets suspected not to overlap with DHS. Specifying depletion will be indicated on the label (the text "Depletion Analysis" will be added to the file label).

=item B<noplot>

Just make the data file, don't plot.

=item B<help|h|?>

Print a brief help message and exits.

=item B<man|m>

Print this perldoc and exit.
